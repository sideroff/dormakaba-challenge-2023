# dormakaba coding challenge

The challenge contains a door list and detail page. The applicants are asked to implement new use cases and fix some bugs based on the web-frontend-developer-challenge.pdf file in this repository.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have at least [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16.13.0 installed.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tests

The project is covered by unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
To run the tests in watch mode, execute:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Linting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) analyzes code for potential errors and enforces coding style consistency. It is executed automatically during build process or by manual execution:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Prettier

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a code formatter to automatically style code for consistency and readability. It is executed as pre commit hook. To run it manually, execute:

```bash
npm run format:write
```

## Build

To create a new production ready build, execute:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Architecture

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project and it has two layers, an `UI` and a `server` layer.

### UI Layer

The UI is written in `React` and also supports server side rendering (SSR).
The UI entry point can be found in the `src/pages` folder. This folder is used for file-system based application routing.
[Next.js routing introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)

The components are located within `src/ui` folder.

### Server Layer

This project has also a small server layer to tailor and optimize the APIs and data for the frontend's specific needs. This pattern is also called [backend for frontend (BFF)](https://blog.bitsrc.io/bff-pattern-backend-for-frontend-an-introduction-e4fa965128bf).
The server layer is based on [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and has a file-system based routing starting at `/src/pages/api` folder.
